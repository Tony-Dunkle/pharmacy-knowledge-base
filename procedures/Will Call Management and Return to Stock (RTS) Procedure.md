# Will Call Management and Return to Stock (RTS) Procedure

This note outlines the daily procedure for managing prescriptions in the **Will Call** area using the [[PioneerRx]] system. This workflow ensures that patients are reminded to pick up their medications and that unclaimed prescriptions are returned to inventory in a timely manner. Adhering to this process is critical for accurate [[Inventory Management]], minimizing waste, and ensuring [[HIPAA]] compliance during patient outreach.

The process is divided into two key time frames: a 4-day check for patient notification and a 10-day check for returning items to stock.

***

## Daily Will Call Review

This process must be performed every day. The primary tool for this is the **Will Call Return Report**, which provides a clear list of prescriptions that have been waiting for pickup.

### How to Print the Will Call Return Report

1.  **Navigate to Reports**: From the main PioneerRx screen, click on the **Reports** tab or menu item.
2.  **Locate the Will Call Report**: Within the reports section, find and select the report specifically named **"Will Call Return Report"** or a similar title. This report is distinct from the general Return to Stock queue.
3.  **Set the Date Parameters**: Configure the report to show prescriptions that have been in Will Call for **4 days or more**. You may need to run it a second time for the 10-day list or use a single report that covers all relevant time frames.
4.  **Print the Report**: Generate and print the report. This physical list will serve as your action plan for the day's Will Call management tasks.

## Actionable Time Frames & Procedures

### 4-Day Check: Patient Notification

* **Objective**: To proactively and securely remind customers that they have prescriptions ready for pickup.
* **Procedure**:
    1.  Using the printed report, identify all prescriptions that have been in Will Call for **4 days**.
    2.  Call the patient using the [[HIPAA Communication Scripts]] provided below to provide a friendly reminder.
    3.  After the call, **document the communication** in the patient's profile. Note the date and that a "pickup reminder call was made."

### 10-Day Check: Return to Stock (RTS)

* **Objective**: To remove unclaimed prescriptions from Will Call and reverse the claim to return the drug to the pharmacy's active inventory.
* **Procedure**:
    1.  Using the report, identify all prescriptions that have been in Will Call for **10 days**.
    2.  Physically locate and pull these prescription bags from the Will Call bins.
    3.  Place the pulled prescriptions in a designated tote or bucket clearly labeled for **"Return to Stock"** or **"RTS"**.
    4.  This tote should then be processed by a designated pharmacy technician or pharmacist. The process involves:
        * [[Returns and Refunds|Reversing the insurance claim]].
        * Updating the prescription status in the system.
        * Returning the medication bottles to the pharmacy shelves to be dispensed again.

 >[!Warning] Understanding Protected Health Information (PHI)

Under [[HIPAA]], **Protected Health Information (PHI)** is any piece of individually identifiable health information. It is your legal and ethical responsibility to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure. The simple act of confirming that someone is a patient of the pharmacy is a disclosure of PHI.

Common examples of PHI in the pharmacy include, but are not limited to:
* Patient names, especially when linked to the pharmacy
* Addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth
* Prescription numbers
* Medication names, strengths, and instructions
* Medical conditions or diagnoses
* Insurance and billing information

**Never reveal any of this information without first verifying the identity of the person you are speaking to.** The communication scripts below are designed specifically to prevent accidental disclosure.

***

## HIPAA Communication Scripts for Patient Calls

>[!info] 
To avoid violating [[HIPAA]] and disclosing **PHI**, all staff must use the following scripts when making reminder calls. **Never** mention specific medication names or health conditions in a voicemail or before verifying the patient's identity.

### Script 1: Leaving a Voicemail

"Hello, this is [Your Name] calling from The Franklin Pharmacy for [Patient's Full Name]. We have an item ready for you to pick up at your convenience. Our phone number is [Pharmacy Phone Number]. Thank you."

* **Why it works**: This message confirms who the call is for without revealing the nature of the "item" (a prescription), protecting the patient's privacy from anyone who might hear the message.

### Script 2: Speaking to an Answering Person (Identity Not Yet Verified)

"Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I'm calling from The Franklin Pharmacy. May I please speak with [Patient's Full Name]?"

* **If the patient is available**: Proceed to Script 3.
* **If the person asks for the reason**: "I'm calling to let them know we have an item ready for pickup here at the pharmacy." Do not provide more detail.
* **If the patient is not available**: "Thank you, I will try again later." Or, if appropriate, "May I leave a message?" If yes, use the voicemail script.

### Script 3: Speaking Directly to the Patient (After Verification)

"Hello [Patient Name], this is [Your Name] from The Franklin Pharmacy. For your privacy, can you please verify your date of birth for me?"

*(Wait for the patient to provide their date of birth and confirm it matches their profile.)*

"Thank you. I'm just calling to give you a friendly reminder that your prescription is ready for pickup. We're open until [Closing Time] today."

> [!info] 
>  **Verification is Mandatory**: Always verify a patient's identity (e.g., with date of birth or address) before confirming that you have a prescription for them.
