# Wallberg Family Pharmacy Care - Fill Workflow

This note defines the operational procedures, turnaround times, and cutoff policies for prescriptions processed by **Care - Fill**, the off-site filling and delivery service for Wallberg Family Pharmacy.

***

## Identifying a Care - Fill Prescription

To determine if a prescription has been routed to the Care - Fill service, you must check the notes within the prescription processing screen in [[PioneerRx]].

* **Identifier**: The prescription will be clearly marked with a `CFxRX` note. This note signifies that the prescription is currently in the Care - Fill queue and is not physically located at the local pharmacy.

***

## Standard Turnaround Time

The baseline expectation for any prescription sent to Care - Fill for either filling or delivery is a **two-day turnaround**. This period begins on the business day the request is processed.

***

## Critical Cutoff Times & Delays

Specific cutoff times affect the standard two-day turnaround. It is crucial to communicate these timelines accurately to patients to manage their expectations.

### 1. Delivery Request Cutoff (2:00 PM)

This rule applies specifically to prescriptions that are being delivered to a patient's home, business, or another external location.

* **Standard Delivery**: If the refill request is processed **before 2:00 PM**, the delivery will occur two days later.
* **Delayed Delivery**: If the refill request is processed **after 2:00 PM**, an extra day is added to the process. The delivery will occur **three days** later.

### 2. End-of-Day Submission Cutoff (4:00 PM)

This is the final cutoff for all prescriptions being sent to the Care - Fill service for the day.

* **Standard Processing**: Prescriptions sent to Care - Fill **before 4:00 PM** fall within the standard two-day turnaround window.
* **Delayed Processing**: Any prescription sent to Care - Fill **after 4:00 PM** will be delayed by one business day, resulting in a **three-day waiting period** before it is ready.
