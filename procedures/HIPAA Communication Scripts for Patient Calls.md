 >[!Warning] Understanding Protected Health Information (PHI)

Under [[HIPAA]], **Protected Health Information (PHI)** is any piece of individually identifiable health information. It is your legal and ethical responsibility to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure. The simple act of confirming that someone is a patient of the pharmacy is a disclosure of PHI.

Common examples of PHI in the pharmacy include, but are not limited to:
* Patient names, especially when linked to the pharmacy
* Addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth
* Prescription numbers
* Medication names, strengths, and instructions
* Medical conditions or diagnoses
* Insurance and billing information

**Never reveal any of this information without first verifying the identity of the person you are speaking to.** The communication scripts below are designed specifically to prevent accidental disclosure.

## HIPAA Communication Scripts for Patient Calls

>[!info] 
To avoid violating [[HIPAA]] and disclosing **PHI**, all staff must use the following scripts when making reminder calls. **Never** mention specific medication names or health conditions in a voicemail or before verifying the patient's identity.

### Script 1: Leaving a Voicemail

"Hello, this is [Your Name] calling from The Franklin Pharmacy for [Patient's Full Name]. We have an item ready for you to pick up at your convenience. Our phone number is [Pharmacy Phone Number]. Thank you."

* **Why it works**: This message confirms who the call is for without revealing the nature of the "item" (a prescription), protecting the patient's privacy from anyone who might hear the message.

### Script 2: Speaking to an Answering Person (Identity Not Yet Verified)

"Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I'm calling from The Franklin Pharmacy. May I please speak with [Patient's Full Name]?"

* **If the patient is available**: Proceed to Script 3.
* **If the person asks for the reason**: "I'm calling to let them know we have an item ready for pickup here at the pharmacy." Do not provide more detail.
* **If the patient is not available**: "Thank you, I will try again later." Or, if appropriate, "May I leave a message?" If yes, use the voicemail script.

### Script 3: Speaking Directly to the Patient (After Verification)

"Hello [Patient Name], this is [Your Name] from The Franklin Pharmacy. For your privacy, can you please verify your date of birth for me?"

*(Wait for the patient to provide their date of birth and confirm it matches their profile.)*

"Thank you. I'm just calling to give you a friendly reminder that your prescription is ready for pickup. We're open until [Closing Time] today."

* **Verification is Mandatory**: Always verify a patient's identity (e.g., with date of birth or address) before confirming that you have a prescription for them.
