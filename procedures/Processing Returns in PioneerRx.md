# Processing Returns in PioneerRx

This note outlines the standard operating procedure for processing patient returns at the [[Point of Sale (POS)]] within the [[PioneerRx]] system. Properly handling returns is essential for maintaining accurate financial records, ensuring correct [[Inventory Management]], and delivering good customer service.

A return involves reversing a sale, refunding the patient's payment, and adjusting inventory counts accordingly. The process is designed to be fully auditable.

***

## Initiating the Return

There are two primary methods for locating the original transaction to begin a return. The preferred method is using the original receipt.

1.  **Using Post-Receipt Scan (Preferred Method)**
    * This is the fastest and most accurate method.
    * From a clear [[Point of Sale (POS)]] screen, simply scan the barcode on the patient's receipt.
    * The system will immediately retrieve the complete transaction. For more details, see the [[Post-Receipt Scan]] note.

2.  **Manual Transaction Lookup**
    * Use this method if the patient does not have their receipt.
    * Search for and select the patient's profile.
    * Navigate to their **Sales History** or **Transaction History** tab.
    * Locate the correct transaction based on the date, items sold, and total amount.
    * Select the transaction and choose the option to **"Return Items"**.

## Step-by-Step Return and Refund Process

Once the original transaction has been recalled, the return process is straightforward.

1.  **Select Items for Return**: A list of all items from the original purchase will be displayed. Check the box next to each item the patient wishes to return.
2.  **Specify Quantity**: If a patient is returning only a portion of a multi-quantity purchase (e.g., returning 1 of 2 purchased OTC items), adjust the quantity field accordingly.
3.  **Select a Return Reason**: The system will prompt you to select a reason for the return from a dropdown menu (e.g., "Patient Refused," "Damaged Item," "Wrong Product"). This is a mandatory step for reporting and auditing purposes.
4.  **Confirm the Refund Amount**: The system will automatically calculate the total refund amount, including any applicable sales tax.
5.  **Process the Refund**: Click the finalize/process button. The system will then prompt you to issue the refund. The method should mirror the original payment:
    * **Credit/Debit Card**: The refund **must** be issued back to the original card used for the purchase. The system will prompt for the card to be inserted or swiped into the PIN pad terminal to process the credit. This is a critical step for [[PCI Compliance]].
    * **Cash**: The refund will be paid out from the cash drawer. The drawer will typically pop open automatically.
    * **[[Accounts Receivable (A/R)]]**: If the item was originally charged to a house account, a credit will be applied to the patient's A/R balance. No cash or card refund is issued.
6.  **Complete the Transaction**: A new receipt will print, documenting the return and the refund issued. This should be given to the patient.

### Key Considerations and Best Practices

> [!warning] **Prescription Medication Returns**:
> **Crucial Compliance Point**. In almost all jurisdictions, once a prescription medication has left the pharmacy's control, **it cannot be returned to stock or dispensed to another patient**. When processing a return for a prescription, you are performing a **financial transaction** only. The medication itself must be handled according to state board of pharmacy regulations, which usually requires it to be set aside for proper destruction.

> * **Inventory Impact**: For over-the-counter (OTC) and front-end merchandise, a completed return automatically adds the item's quantity back into your on-hand inventory. For returned prescriptions that cannot be restocked, manual inventory adjustments may be required depending on your pharmacy's specific workflow for destroyed medications.
> * **[[Controlled Substances]]**: Returns involving controlled substances are subject to strict regulations and may require additional documentation or pharmacist intervention. Always follow pharmacy policy and legal requirements.
> * **User Permissions**: The ability to process returns is often restricted by [[User Permissions]]. A cashier may need a manager's or pharmacist's override to complete the transaction.
