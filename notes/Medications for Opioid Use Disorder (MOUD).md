# Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD)

> [!warning] Medical Disclaimer & Sensitive Topic Warning
> The information in this note is for educational purposes only and is **not** a substitute for professional medical advice. Treatment for [[Opioid Use Disorder]] should only be managed by a qualified healthcare professional. This topic involves substance use and addiction, which may be sensitive for some readers.

Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) are the most effective, evidence-based treatment for individuals with an addiction to opioids. They are endorsed by leading medical organizations as the standard of care. These medications work by targeting the same [[Opioid Receptors]] in the brain that drugs like [[Heroin]], [[Fentanyl]], or prescription painkillers act upon. This intervention helps to **stabilize brain chemistry**, **relieve withdrawal symptoms**, **reduce or eliminate cravings**, and **block the euphoric effects** of other opioids. MOUD allows individuals to focus on recovery and reduces the risk of overdose and other health complications.

The primary medications used fall into three categories:
* **[[Opioid Agonists]]**: Fully activate opioid receptors.
* **[[Partial Agonists]]**: Activate opioid receptors to a lesser degree than full agonists.
* **[[Opioid Antagonists]]**: Block opioid receptors, preventing other opioids from activating them.

## Buprenorphine
- **Pronunciation:** byoo-preh-NOR-feen
- **Mechanism of Action:** A **[[Partial Agonists|partial opioid agonist]]**. This is a critical feature. Buprenorphine binds very strongly to the mu-opioid receptors (**high affinity**) but only stimulates them partially (**low intrinsic activity**).
    -   This creates a **"ceiling effect"**; at a certain dose, taking more buprenorphine does not increase the opioid effects (like euphoria or respiratory depression). This makes it significantly safer in terms of overdose risk compared to full agonists.
    -   Because of its high affinity, it can displace other opioids like heroin or methadone from the receptors, which can lead to [[Precipitated Withdrawal]] if not started correctly.
- **Primary Use:** A first-line, office-based treatment for [[Opioid Use Disorder]]. It is widely accessible through primary care physicians with a specialized "X-waiver" (though regulations are evolving).

### Formulations and Key Differences

#### Buprenorphine/Naloxone (Combination Product)
- **Common Brand Name:** **Suboxone**
- **Formulations:** Primarily available as a sublingual film (strip) or tablet. 
- **The Role of Naloxone:** [[Naloxone]] is an opioid antagonist that is added to deter misuse.
    -   **Sublingual Administration:** When the film or tablet is dissolved under the tongue as prescribed, the buprenorphine is absorbed into the bloodstream, but the naloxone is not (it has very poor sublingual bioavailability). The naloxone remains inert.
    -   **Attempted IV Misuse:** If a user attempts to dissolve the product and inject it, the naloxone *will* be absorbed systemically. It will immediately block opioid receptors and induce severe, sudden withdrawal symptoms in a person with opioid dependence. This acts as a powerful deterrent.
- **Strips vs. Tablets:**
    -   **Strips (Films):** Often preferred clinically. They dissolve more quickly and consistently than tablets. They come in individually sealed, child-resistant packets, which can reduce the risk of accidental ingestion. Some patients report less unpleasant taste.
    -   **Tablets:** Can be less expensive. Some patients may prefer the familiar format of a pill. Dissolution can sometimes be less consistent.

#### Buprenorphine Monoproduct (Without Naloxone)
- **Common Brand Name:** **Subutex**
- **Primary Use:** Generally reserved for specific clinical situations where the naloxone component is a concern.
    -   **Pregnancy:** Often the preferred formulation for pregnant individuals to avoid any potential fetal exposure to naloxone, though Suboxone is also considered safe.
    -   **Known Allergies:** For rare patients with a documented allergy to naloxone.
    -   **Induction Phase:** Sometimes used during the initial "induction" phase of treatment in a directly supervised setting.

#### Long-Acting Injectable Buprenorphine
- **Common Brand Name:** **Sublocade**
- **Formulation:** A subcutaneous (under the skin) injection administered by a healthcare provider **once per month**.
- **Primary Use:** For patients who have been stable on a regular daily dose of sublingual buprenorphine for at least a week.
-   **Advantages:** Eliminates the need for daily dosing, which improves adherence and removes the risks of lost, stolen, or diverted medication. It provides a steady-state level of medication in the body, which can lead to better craving control for some individuals.

## Methadone
- **Pronunciation:** METH-a-dohn
- **Common Brand Name:** Dolophine
- **Mechanism of Action:** A long-acting **[[Opioid Agonists|full opioid agonist]]**. It fully activates opioid receptors, similar to other opioids, but its long half-life allows for once-daily dosing. It effectively eliminates withdrawal and cravings without producing the intense, short-lived euphoria of drugs like heroin.
- **Primary Use:** A highly effective treatment for [[Opioid Use Disorder]], especially for individuals with a high level of physical dependence or who have not been successful with buprenorphine.
- **Regulation:** Due to its status as a full agonist and its potential for overdose and diversion, methadone treatment is highly regulated. It can only be dispensed through a certified Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) clinic, which requires patients, especially early in treatment, to visit daily for their dose.

## Naltrexone
- **Pronunciation:** nal-TREX-ohn
- **Mechanism of Action:** An **[[Opioid Antagonists|opioid antagonist]]**. It binds to opioid receptors and provides a complete blockade, preventing any opioid from producing an effect. It is **not** an opioid, is non-addictive, and does not relieve withdrawal or cravings.
- **Crucial Clinical Consideration:** A person **must be fully detoxed and opioid-free for 7-10 days before starting naltrexone**. If taken while opioids are still in the system, it will cause [[Precipitated Withdrawal]], a rapid and severe withdrawal syndrome that can be medically dangerous.

### Formulations and Key Differences

#### Long-Acting Injectable Naltrexone
- **Common Brand Name:** **Vivitrol**
- **Formulation:** An intramuscular injection administered by a healthcare provider **once per month**.
- **Primary Use:** A relapse-prevention medication for highly motivated individuals who have completed detoxification. It is also FDA-approved for Alcohol Use Disorder.
- **Advantages:** The monthly injection ensures adherence. By blocking the euphoric effects, it can help extinguish the learned behaviors associated with drug use.

#### Oral Naltrexone
- **Common Brand Name:** Revia
- **Formulation:** A daily pill.
- **Disadvantages:** Its effectiveness is limited by the need for strict daily adherence. A person can simply decide not to take their pill if they wish to return to opioid use. It is less commonly used for OUD than the injectable form for this reason.
