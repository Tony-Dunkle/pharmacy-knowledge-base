# Sedatives and Hypnotics ("Sleeping Pills")

> [!warning] Medical Disclaimer & High Risk Warning
> The information in this note is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Sedative-hypnotic drugs carry a **high risk of dependence, tolerance, and abuse**. They should only be used under the strict supervision of a healthcare provider, typically for short-term use. Abruptly stopping these medications can cause severe withdrawal.

**Sedative-hypnotics** are a class of drugs that cause dose-dependent depression of the Central Nervous System (CNS).
* At lower doses, they act as **sedatives**, reducing anxiety and calming the user (anxiolytic effect).
* At higher doses, they act as **hypnotics**, inducing drowsiness and promoting sleep.

These drugs primarily work by enhancing the activity of **GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)**, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Increased GABAergic activity "quiets down" the brain, leading to sedation.

## Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines were a revolutionary treatment for anxiety and insomnia when introduced. While still used, their long-term risks are now better understood.

-   **Mechanism of Action:** They bind to a specific site on the GABA-A receptor, which increases the *frequency* of the channel opening. This enhances the inhibitory effect of GABA, leading to widespread CNS depression.
-   **Common Suffix:** **-azepam** or **-azolam**
-   **Key Drugs (by use/duration):**
    -   **For Sleep (Hypnotics):**
        -   **Temazepam** (te-MAZ-e-pam) - Brand Name: **Restoril**. Intermediate-acting, good for staying asleep.
        -   **Triazolam** (trye-AY-zoe-lam) - Brand Name: **Halcion**. Very short-acting, good for falling asleep but can cause rebound anxiety.
    -   **For Anxiety (Anxiolytics):**
        -   **Alprazolam** (al-PRAY-zoe-lam) - Brand Name: **Xanax**. Short-acting, high abuse potential.
        -   **Lorazepam** (lor-AZ-e-pam) - Brand Name: **Ativan**. Intermediate-acting.
        -   **Diazepam** (dye-AZ-e-pam) - Brand Name: **Valium**. Long-acting, also used as a muscle relaxant.
-   **Key Risks & Side Effects:**
    -   **Dependence and Tolerance:** The body adapts to the drug, requiring higher doses for the same effect and leading to a withdrawal syndrome upon cessation.
    -   **Next-day drowsiness** ("hangover effect"), cognitive impairment, and amnesia.
    -   **Respiratory Depression:** Dangerous when combined with other CNS depressants like alcohol or opioids.

## Non-Benzodiazepine Receptor Agonists ("Z-Drugs")

This class was developed to have a similar hypnotic effect to benzodiazepines but with a better side-effect profile. They are more selective for the hypnotic effects of GABA stimulation versus the anxiolytic effects.

-   **Mechanism of Action:** Like benzodiazepines, they bind to the GABA-A receptor, but they are more selective for a specific subtype (alpha-1) that is primarily responsible for inducing sleep.
-   **Key Drugs (all start with "Z"):**
    -   **Zolpidem** (ZOL-pi-dem) - Brand Name: **Ambien**. The most well-known. Short half-life, effective at initiating sleep. An extended-release (CR) version helps with staying asleep.
    -   **Zaleplon** (ZAL-e-plon) - Brand Name: **Sonata**. Very short half-life, can be taken in the middle of the night if there are at least 4 hours of sleep time remaining.
    -   **Eszopiclone** (es-ZOP-i-klohn) - Brand Name: **Lunesta**. Longer half-life, effective for both falling asleep and staying asleep, but has a higher risk of next-day drowsiness.
-   **Key Risks & Side Effects:**
    -   **Complex Sleep-Related Behaviors:** This is a major warning for this class. It includes activities like sleep-walking, sleep-driving, making phone calls, or eating while not fully awake, with no memory of the event.
    -   A notable side effect of Eszopiclone is a **bitter or metallic taste**.
    -   While thought to be safer, they still carry risks of dependence and tolerance similar to benzodiazepines.

## Orexin Receptor Antagonists

This is the newest class of hypnotic medications, working on a completely different neurotransmitter system.

-   **Mechanism of Action:** The [[Orexin]] system in the brain is a central promoter of wakefulness. These drugs block orexin receptors, thereby **suppressing the "wake drive"** rather than enhancing the "sleep drive" like GABAergic drugs. This is thought to mimic the natural process of falling asleep more closely.
-   **Common Suffix:** **-orexant**
-   **Key Drugs:**
    -   **Suvorexant** (soo-voe-REX-ant) - Brand Name: **Belsomra**
    -   **Lemborexant** (lem-boe-REX-ant) - Brand Name: **Dayvigo**
-   **Primary Clinical Use:** Treatment of [[Insomnia]] characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance.
-   **Key Side Effects:**
    -   Daytime sleepiness.
    -   Sleep paralysis and dream-like hallucinations (hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations) can occur.
