# Diuretics ("Water Pills")

**Diuretics** are a class of medications that promote diuresisâ€”the increased excretion of urine. They work primarily by acting on the [[Kidney|kidneys]] to increase the amount of salt (sodium) and water that is removed from the body. This reduction in overall fluid volume makes them a cornerstone treatment for conditions involving fluid retention ([[Edema]]) and high blood pressure ([[Hypertension]]).

Different classes of diuretics target different parts of the **nephron**, the functional unit of the kidney, which dictates their potency and clinical use.

## Loop Diuretics

This is the **most potent** class of diuretics. They are called "loop" diuretics because they act on a specific part of the nephron called the thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle.

-   **Mechanism of Action:** They inhibit the Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter (NKCC2), preventing the reabsorption of a significant amount of sodium and chloride from the urine back into the blood. Water follows salt, so a large volume of water is also excreted.
-   **Key Drugs:**
    -   **Furosemide** (fur-OH-se-mide) - Brand Name: **Lasix**
    -   **Bumetanide** (byoo-MET-a-nide) - Brand Name: Bumex
    -   **Torsemide** (TOR-se-mide) - Brand Name: Demadex
-   **Primary Clinical Uses:**
    -   Managing significant fluid overload ([[Edema]]) in conditions like congestive [[Heart Failure]], liver cirrhosis, and severe kidney disease.
    -   They are generally **not** first-line for hypertension due to their powerful, short-acting nature.
-   **Key Side Effects:**
    -   Significant electrolyte imbalances, especially low potassium (**[[Hypokalemia]]**).
    -   Dehydration and low blood pressure (hypotension).
    -   Ototoxicity (hearing loss), particularly at high doses or when given intravenously.

## Thiazide and Thiazide-Like Diuretics

This is one of the **most commonly prescribed** classes of diuretics, particularly for managing high blood pressure.

-   **Mechanism of Action:** They inhibit the Sodium-Chloride Cotransporter (NCC) in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron. This action is less powerful than that of loop diuretics but provides a sustained, gentle diuretic and antihypertensive effect.
-   **Key Drugs:**
    -   **Hydrochlorothiazide** (hye-droe-klor-oh-THYE-a-zide) - Often abbreviated as **HCTZ**. Brand Name: Microzide.
    -   **Chlorthalidone** (klor-THAL-i-dohn) - A "thiazide-like" diuretic that is longer-acting and often preferred for hypertension management.
    -   **Metolazone** (me-TOL-a-zone) - A potent thiazide-like diuretic sometimes used in combination with a loop diuretic for severe, resistant edema.
-   **Primary Clinical Uses:**
    -   **First-line treatment for [[Hypertension]]**.
    -   Mild to moderate [[Edema]].
-   **Key Side Effects:**
    -   Low potassium (**[[Hypokalemia]]**).
    -   Increased uric acid levels, which can precipitate a [[Gout]] attack.
    -   Increased blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia).

## Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

This is a weaker class of diuretics whose primary advantage is that they **do not cause potassium loss**. They are often used in combination with thiazide or loop diuretics to counteract their potassium-wasting effects. They act on the collecting duct of the nephron.

### 1. Aldosterone Antagonists

-   **Mechanism of Action:** These drugs block the action of aldosterone, a hormone that is part of the [[Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System]]. Aldosterone normally promotes sodium reabsorption in exchange for potassium excretion. By blocking it, these drugs cause sodium and water to be excreted while **potassium is retained**.
-   **Key Drugs:**
    -   **Spironolactone** (speer-oh-no-LAK-tohn) - Brand Name: Aldactone
    -   **Eplerenone** (e-PLER-e-nohn) - Brand Name: Inspra
-   **Primary Clinical Uses:**
    -   [[Heart Failure]] (has proven mortality benefits beyond its diuretic effect).
    -   Resistant hypertension.
    -   Liver failure (ascites).
-   **Key Side Effects:**
    -   High potassium (**[[Hyperkalemia]]**), which can be dangerous.
    -   **Gynecomastia** (breast enlargement in men) is a notable side effect of spironolactone due to its effects on androgen receptors.

### 2. ENaC Inhibitors

-   **Mechanism of Action:** These drugs directly block the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the collecting duct, preventing sodium from being reabsorbed.
-   **Key Drugs:**
    -   **Triamterene** (trye-AM-ter-een)
    -   **Amiloride** (a-MIL-oh-ride)
-   **Primary Clinical Uses:** Almost exclusively used in combination products (e.g., with HCTZ) to prevent [[Hypokalemia]].
-   **Key Side Effects:** High potassium (**[[Hyperkalemia]]**).
